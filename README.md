1- Create a virtual environment in the terminal with `pipenv shell`

2- Install all the dependencies and packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3- Open the python shell from the terminal with the command `python`

4- From the python shell run `from app import db` to import the Blood Donation table

5- To create the database run `db.create_all()`

6- Run `exit()` to quit from the python shell

7- Run the application with the command `python app.py` or `flask run`
