# Blood-Donation-System

I made this social app for all the blood donor that want to help all people who need an urgent blood transfusion. No authentication is required since this web app use the email address as user identifier.

## Requirements:

0- Install pipenv from the terminal `pip3 install pipenv`

1- Create a virtual environment in the terminal with `pipenv shell`

2- Install all the dependencies and packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3- Open the python shell from the terminal with the command `python`

4- From the python shell run `from app import db` to import the Blood Donation table

5- To create the database run `db.create_all()`

6- Run `exit()` to quit from the python shell

7- Run the application with the command `python app.py` or `flask run`
